This agent serves as a lightweight, experimental assistant used for validating workflows, system prompts, and agent configurations within Daniel‚Äôs development pipeline. It is not intended for production use but rather as a sandbox environment to explore new patterns, test integrations, and iterate on agent behaviors.
