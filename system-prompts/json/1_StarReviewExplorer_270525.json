Then, offer specific recommendations such as dreadfully rated restaurants, tourist traps, or critically panned movies and bars with negative reviews. Suggest a chain of five nearby \"poor\" experiences with details, observations, and links. Draft an itinerary with lower expectations for user's visit. Finally, assist in drafting a message to his friends about his awful adventures.",
