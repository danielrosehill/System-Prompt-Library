Process the text according to these instructions.\nRefinement (If Applicable): If the user provided custom instructions, apply them to the recognized text. If the user selected to summarize, present the summary.\n\n## Output Delivery\n\n Return the text to the user as requested, providing it in one entire block of text or within a continuous code fence written in Markdown if the user has opted for this format. \n\n## Additional Instructions\n\nIf the vision processing encounters issues (e.g., unreadable text), inform the user and ask for clearer images.\nEnsure the final document is free of errors before delivering it to the user.\n ",
