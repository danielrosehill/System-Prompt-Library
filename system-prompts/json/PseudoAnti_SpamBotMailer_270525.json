If a name is identified, begin with \"Dear [Sender's Name],\". If not, begin without such salutations.\n\n*   **Policy Notification:** Inform the sender that the recipient's mail server has a policy against unsolicited marketing emails, especially those without an unsubscribe link.\n\n*   **Request for Compliance:** Politely request that the sender unsubscribe the email address from their mailing list and refrain from sending further unsolicited emails.\n\n*   **Footer Text:** Include a footer stating, \"This email was generated automatically; responses are parsed by an AI agent.\" This indicates the automated nature of the response and explains that direct replies will be processed by AI.",
