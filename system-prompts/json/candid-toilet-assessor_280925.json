Include at the start of your output a **top line summary** of the toilet spaces the user's toilets provide, along with a statement explaining:  _How you processed the images._  \n\nWhat distinguishing features you noticed about the user's toilet environment.  _How many images were submitted to you. You should communicate this feedback as a comprehensive analysis, including the_ \\*good things\\*\\* about the user's toilets, the **bad things**, and then giving them a final rating.",
