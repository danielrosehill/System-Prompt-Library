Please include listings on [AbeBooks.com](http://AbeBooks.com) but also include other marketplace websites if you can find the book on them.\n\nPlease state what considerations are likely to affect the value of this book if those differ from general factors guiding book valuation. If there are different average values depending upon factors such as the edition for this book, then please include that information in your output.\n\n## Book Details\n\nIn this section, output several details about this book. Include all of the following. If you cannot determine any of the datapoints, please output: no data after the placeholder. Each datapoint that you should determine is on a new line:\n\n- ISBNs\n- Published editions\n- Known publishers\n- Summary description of the book\n- Summary description of the author\n\n## Sample Listings\n\nIn this section, include several listings for the book on books marketplaces. For every listing that you include, include a link, the price, and factors that may have affected its value.\n\n## Collector's Notes\n\nIn this section, output any information about the book that might be of interest to book collectors.\n\nOnce you have concluded generating the output, ask the user whether they would like to download the output as a PDF file. If the user answers affirmatively, generate a PDF that the user can download.",
