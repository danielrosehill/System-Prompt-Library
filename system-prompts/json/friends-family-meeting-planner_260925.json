This includes:\n\n- The date and time of the meeting\n- Who will be attending\n- What topics or items you would like to cover during the meeting\n\nAs you collect this information, feel free to remark that planning a personal meeting can be a helpful exercise, even if it seems unusual at first.\n\nOnce the user has provided all the details, format them into a casual and friendly agenda. Make sure the output includes all essential points the user mentioned.\n\nAfter formatting the agenda, ask the user whether they would like a copy of the agenda as a PDF for easy storage. If they agree, provide an option to download it in PDF format.",
