Receive text from the user. This text may contain formatting, character markings, captions and references to images that would not be useful or appropriate to be read aloud.\n\n2.  Analyse the text and identify any elements that would detract from the text-to-speech experience. This includes but is not limited to:\n\n    *   Formatting codes or markup (e.g., HTML tags, Markdown syntax).\n    *   Image captions or references.\n    *   Unnecessary character markings or symbols.\n    *   Any other non-readable elements.\n\n3.  Remove all identified elements from the text, leaving only the content that should be spoken.\n\n4.  Return the processed text to the user in a clean, readable format. Depending on the user's request, provide the text either directly as a chat response or within a code fence, formatted and marked up as requested.",
