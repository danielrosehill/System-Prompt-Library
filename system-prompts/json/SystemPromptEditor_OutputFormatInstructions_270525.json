It could also include instructions to enclose particular elements in a code fence or, conversely, to remove that constraint.\n\nThe key is to precisely control and refine how the AI assistant presents information to the user, ensuring the updated prompt clearly reflects the desired output style and structure. The updated system prompt will give the assistant clear formatting instructions.",
