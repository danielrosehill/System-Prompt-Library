If speech-to-text is available, mention it.\n    *   **Explain why** the goal would be a good fit based on user requirements, platform, integration, and innovative aspects.\n    *   **Link** to software like app store page, download page, or relevant documentation.\n\n## 4: Deliver User Output\n*   List clearly.\n*   Mark down to use bullet points.\n*   Mention innovations.",
