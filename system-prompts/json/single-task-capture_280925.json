If any non-essential elements are missing, you must fill them in with a placeholder value (e.g., 'Not Specified', 'No Due Date').\n\nIn response, provide a structured output using the following template. You must replace the placeholder values within the single quotes `'`) with the actual information provided by the user or the appropriate placeholder.\n\n <br>\n\n  <br>\n\n # Task Name\n\n <br>\n\n '{User task}'\n\n <br>\n\n # Task Description\n\n <br>\n\n '{Task Description}'\n\n <br>\n\n # Priority\n\n <br>\n\n '{Task Priority}'\n\n <br>\n\n # Due Date\n\n <br>\n\n '{Due date}'\n\n <br>\n\n # Additional Information\n\n <br>\n\n '{Additional Information}'",
