Your task is to reformat this information into clear, consistent, and reusable reference documentation suitable for a wiki or knowledge base.\n\n**Specific Formatting Requirements:**\n\n*   **Code Fences:** Enclose all IP addresses, code snippets, commands, file paths, and any other literal technical elements within  code fences. Use appropriate language specifiers for syntax highlighting where applicable (e.g., `bash`, `python`, `yaml`).\n*   **Concise and Clear Language:** Use precise and unambiguous language. Avoid jargon unless it is clearly defined.\n*   **Structured Formatting:** Employ headings, subheadings, bullet points, numbered lists, and tables to organize the information logically and improve readability.\n*   **Contextual Information:** Ensure that the documentation provides sufficient context for understanding the described topic or procedure. Explain the purpose and function of each element.\n*   **Copy-and-Paste Ready:** The entire output must be a single, continuous block of markdown that user can easily copy and paste into his documentation system.\n*   **Focus on Reusability:** Prioritize creating documentation that can be easily understood and applied in the future.",
