## About This Prompt Collection

This repository contains an evolving index of system prompts for AI agents and assistants that I've been developing since the summer of 2024.

This index is a lightly edited replication of my own prompt library: very few entries are excluded. In the interest of making these useful for other people (which is the entire reason I open source as much as I can!) I scripted some basic "depersonalisation" (best practices are evolving, but I think that for this reason alone personalisation elements should be incorporated as variables rather than embedded into system prompts). If you encounter any references to "Daniel" that my cleanup scripts missed, however, just replace with "the user" or your name in your own implementations!

How this enterprise began:
  
My sliding point into the glorious rabbit hole of generative AI (the best one I've explored so far!) was creating custom GPTs.

While I have now created a "decent amount" of complex AI agent workflows, I continue to believe that system prompting plays a foundational and very important role in creating impactful and performant AI experiences. 

System prompts can be used on their own to create simple chatbots; integrated with tooling and MCP to make sure that the LLM knows why it's taking these actions; or even injected directly into conversational interfaces as "pseudo system prompts" - user prompts that try to override the actual system prompt (if one is present) to achieve a specific feel and function to the "interaction". 

Not versioned in this central repository (yet): what could be regarded as specialised categories of system prompts. In this category are: text transformation prompts (my nomenclature for very short system prompts for reformatting raw STT output into more structured writing) as well as "Windsurf Rules" (et al). The latter are effectively system prompts for steering AI code generation agents in their behavior.

While the exact parameters that delineate between "agents" and "assistants" remain blurry and open, to some extent, to interpretation, system prompts are extremely important for both. Unlike user prompts, they're designed to be persistent. I see them as the bedrock or jumping off point for most of my AI experiments. This index is, therefore, a loosely gathered collection of those notes and configs.
 

## Point In Time Exports

I periodically export lightly cleaned versions of the consolidated system prompt file.

These are listed in `exports.md`. The latest is:

[![Hugging Face Dataset - 2025-03-08](https://img.shields.io/badge/ü§ó%20Hugging%20Face-2025--03--08-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=huggingface)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/danielrosehill/System-Prompt-Library-030825)

## Formats

These prompts are mostly now populated from an N8N workflow.

**Markdown** versions are funneled to `system-prompts/md` and **JSON** versions to `system-prompts/json`.

## Data Structure

### JSON Data Model (V2 - August 2025)

This updated data structure includes booleans for:

- Classification (characters, workflows)  
- Architecture reqs (RAG, tooling, APIs) 
- Use-cases and capabilities 
- Data retention policies and compliance 
- Notes about LLM selection, MCP, API

## Repository Contents

### Prompt Types
- **Autonomous Agents**: Complex multi-step reasoning and task execution
- **Chatbots**: Conversational AI with specific personalities or expertise
- **Specialized Assistants**: Domain-specific helpers (technical, creative, analytical)
- **Tool Integrations**: Prompts designed for specific AI platforms and services

### Storage Formats
System prompts are organized into two main formats:
- **JSON Format**: Structured data with metadata (`system-prompts/json/` - 923 files)
- **Markdown Format**: Human-readable documentation (`system-prompts/md/` - 851 files)
