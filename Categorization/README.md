# Categorization

## Overview

This directory provides a structured framework for organizing the 1,295+ system prompts in this library into coherent **multi-agent clusters**. As AI has evolved from simple assistants to sophisticated multi-agent frameworks, many practitioners are re-envisioning how collections of system prompts can work together as coordinated agent networks.

## Objective

The Categorization initiative serves to:

1. **Cluster related system prompts** into functional groups based on their purpose and capabilities
2. **Define orchestration patterns** for how agents within each cluster can coordinate
3. **Recommend multi-agent frameworks** suitable for implementing each cluster
4. **Provide implementation guidance** for deploying clusters as operational multi-agent systems
5. **Enable scalability** toward a unified multi-agent ecosystem where specialized agents handle specific tasks

## Philosophy

Rather than viewing system prompts as isolated configurations, this categorization treats them as potential **agent nodes** in a larger orchestration network. Each cluster represents a domain of functionality where multiple specialized agents can collaborate, delegate, and coordinate to accomplish complex objectives.

## Cluster Structure

Each cluster directory contains:

- **README.md** - Overview of the cluster's purpose, capabilities, and agent roles
- **Orchestration patterns** - Recommended coordination strategies between agents
- **Framework recommendations** - Specific multi-agent frameworks suited to the cluster
- **Relative links** - Direct references to relevant system prompt JSON files in `../system-prompts/json/`

## Clusters

### 1. [Agent Development & Orchestration](./agent-development-orchestration/)
Meta-level agents for building, managing, and orchestrating other AI agents.

### 2. [Code & Development](./code-development/)
Software development, debugging, documentation, and technical implementation agents.

### 3. [Data & Analysis](./data-analysis/)
Data processing, organization, analysis, visualization, and governance agents.

### 4. [Content & Writing](./content-writing/)
Writing, editing, content creation, and documentation agents.

### 5. [Research & Knowledge](./research-knowledge/)
Research, information gathering, analysis, and knowledge synthesis agents.

### 6. [Business & Productivity](./business-productivity/)
Business operations, productivity, workflow automation, and organizational agents.

### 7. [Automation & Integration](./automation-integration/)
Workflow automation, system integration, and process orchestration agents.

### 8. [Personal & Lifestyle](./personal-lifestyle/)
Personal assistance, health, planning, and lifestyle management agents.

### 9. [Creative & Entertainment](./creative-entertainment/)
Creative ideation, entertainment, humor, and experimental agents.

### 10. [Technical Infrastructure](./technical-infrastructure/)
Infrastructure, DevOps, system administration, and technical tooling agents.

## Multi-Agent Framework Recommendations

### Popular Frameworks by Use Case

**General Purpose:**
- **CrewAI** - Role-based agent orchestration with defined tasks and processes
- **AutoGen** - Conversational multi-agent framework with flexible agent interactions
- **LangGraph** - Graph-based agent orchestration with state management

**Specialized:**
- **MetaGPT** - Software development multi-agent framework
- **BabyAGI** - Task-driven autonomous agent system
- **AgentGPT** - Browser-based autonomous agent chains
- **Semantic Kernel** - Enterprise-grade agent orchestration (Microsoft)

**Platform-Based:**
- **n8n** - Low-code workflow automation with AI agent nodes
- **Flowise** - Visual LangChain agent builder
- **Dify.AI** - Agent-as-a-service platform

## Implementation Patterns

### Sequential Orchestration
Agents work in a pipeline, each performing specific tasks in sequence.

### Hierarchical Orchestration
Manager agents delegate to specialized worker agents based on task requirements.

### Collaborative Orchestration
Peer agents negotiate and collaborate to solve complex problems collectively.

### Reactive Orchestration
Event-driven agents respond to triggers and state changes in the environment.

## Getting Started

1. **Explore clusters** - Review cluster READMEs to understand categorization
2. **Identify use cases** - Determine which clusters align with your objectives
3. **Select frameworks** - Choose appropriate multi-agent frameworks for your needs
4. **Configure agents** - Use referenced system prompts as agent configurations
5. **Design orchestration** - Implement coordination patterns between agents
6. **Deploy & iterate** - Launch your multi-agent system and refine based on results

## Vision: Unified Multi-Agent Ecosystem

The ultimate goal is to enable the entire system prompt library to function as **one comprehensive multi-agent framework** - a network of 1,295+ specialized agents that can dynamically coordinate, delegate, and collaborate to handle virtually any task through intelligent orchestration.
