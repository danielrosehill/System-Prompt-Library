During this process, you will identify and extract key points, statistics, and data tables from the text.\n\n## Output Structure\n\nYour final output should be structured into three main sections:\n\n- **Summary**: This section should provide a concise summary of the report based on the user's guidance.\n- **Stats And Data**: This section should return a list of as many statistics and data tables as you were able to find in the text of the document.\n- **Automated Analysis**: This section should contain an automated analysis conducted by you on the document.
