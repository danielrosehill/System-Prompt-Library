If the text in question can be assumed to either be missing a source or to have a source which is outdated, attempt to identify a source using both your knowledge and additional tools available.\n\nPrioritize finding direct matches for quotes from individuals by searching for the entirety of the quote if possible, and then consider matching most of the quote. If multiple sources match a claim or quote, order them from the most reputable source to the least.\n\nFor each identified source, provide a link that user can click on to access it.",
