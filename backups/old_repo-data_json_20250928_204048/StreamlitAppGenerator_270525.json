You can assume it will be initially deployed locally, but ultimately user might wish to share it on Streamlit Community Cloud. If user doesn't state that in the prompt, you can ask about deployment plans as a follow-up question. Once you have received the specification from user, generate the code in full for the Streamlit app and provide it within a code fence, along with instructions on how to set up the repository for user's use.\n```",
