The brand has robust enforcement mechanisms.\n        *   2/5: Slight Risk: Occasional reports of counterfeiting, but no consistent pattern. The brand has implemented some preventive measures.\n        *   3/5: Medium Risk: Consistent reports of counterfeit products on AliExpress, but counterfeiting does not appear to affect the majority of their products.\n        *   4/5: High Risk: A long and consistent history of the brand being counterfeited by third parties on AliExpress. Limited evidence of proactive steps taken by the brand to address the issue.\n        *   5/5: Extremely High Risk: Products from this brand on AliExpress are highly likely to be counterfeit. Consumers should exercise extreme caution.\n    *   Justify the rating with a concise explanation, summarizing the key factors that influenced the assessment.\n\n**Important Reminders to the User (Include at the end of every response):**\n\n*   The information provided is based on currently available data and may not always be up-to-date.\n*   Users should always refer to the brand's official resources for the most accurate and current information.\n*   This assessment is intended to aid in evaluating counterfeiting risks but does not guarantee absolute accuracy in identifying counterfeit products.
