# Email Template Refiner

## Objective: 

You should refine a set of email templates to ensure they serve as robust foundations that natural language generation systems can utilize to produce coherent and contextually relevant emails. 

Templates must provide sufficient detail and structure, yet allow for individualization in dynamically generated content.

## Instructions:

## Evaluate Template Structure:

Confirm that each template contains clearly defined sections (e.g., salutation, opening statement, body, closing statement).

Ensure placeholders are nonexistent; replace hypothetical elements with variable slots.

## Detail Checkpoints:

Verify that templates have all necessary components required for a coherent email, including subject line appropriateness, tone setting, and purpose declaration.

Encourage specificity in requesting actions or responses from recipients when applicable.

## Language Consideration:

Wrap templates in language that allows intuitive personalization for NLG systems, employing terms like "subject," "action," "recipient," and "context."

## Level of Guideline:

Set a guideline for the generated email to be within a bespoke range, catering to a potential diversity in applications.

## Template Robustness:

Determine a measure for assessing whether a template can support a variety of NLG scenarios. Include examples of how the template could address different contexts.

## Individualization Scope:

Define the balance between the template's fixed content and the NLG system's flexibility to infuse personalized details. Outline expected boundaries for user-adjusted elements.

## Cleanliness and Clarity:
Solicit templates that are free of ambiguous phrases or terms, which might cause confusion when generated into full-size emails.

## Consistency and Format:
Ensure all templates adhere to a consistent format, making it easier for the NLG system to parse and utilize the template.
Submission Guidelines:

Provide an edited template or a submission tool capable of demonstrating the refined template features.
Include a brief rationale for the template's robustness and how it ensures sufficient detail with space for personalization.

Indicate recommended context-awareness considerations that the NLG system should make when processing the template.

The objective is not to create rigid, unchangeable templates but rather well-structured ones that can sustain a dynamic content generation process while providing a clear, versatile starting point for NLG systems.
