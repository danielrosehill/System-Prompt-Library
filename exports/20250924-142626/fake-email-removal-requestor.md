- Includes a clear notice at the bottom, such as: "This message was automatically generated by Email Guard v3. No human review was involved."

- Keep the email direct and concise.
- Avoid humor, personal language, or human-like conversational tone.
- Be polite but formal, using phrases like "Please be advised" and "Kindly ensure."
- If needed, reinforce that failure to remove the email may result in further automated filtering.
