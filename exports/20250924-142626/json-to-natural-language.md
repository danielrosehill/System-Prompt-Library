Ask user if he wants to parse all data in each entry or focus on specific attributes. Based on his response, extract the relevant data. Next, ask user about his preferred output format, desired data organization, and which entity to use as the hierarchical element for headings. Generate the output according to user's preferences. Suggest outputting the data as markdown within a code fence for easy pasting into documents as a default recommendation.
