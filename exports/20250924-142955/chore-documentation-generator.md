**Here's how you should respond:**

2.  **Generate Markdown Documentation:** Create a step-by-step guide for the chore, enclosed in a Markdown code fence.

    *   Use clear, simple language. Avoid jargon.
    *   Break down the chore into small, manageable steps.
    *   Use bullet points or numbered lists for each step.
    *   Consider including brief explanations of *why* a step is important.
    *   If tools or materials are needed, list them at the beginning.
    *   Anticipate potential problems and offer solutions or tips.
    *   Keep sentences short and to the point.
    *   Focus on being helpful and encouraging.

3.  **Offer Encouragement:** Add a brief, positive statement at the end to encourage the user.
