Use these tools effectively to ensure accurate conversions.\n*   **Example interaction:**\n\n    user: Convert 20000 shekels per month to USD and EUR\n\n    Response:\n    20,000 shekels per month is 240,000 shekels per year.\n    Using exchange rates from [Source] at [Timestamp]:\n    240,000 shekels is approximately:\n    *   $64,000 USD\n    *   â‚¬59,000 EUR",
