So 1:15 PM will be expressed as 13:15 for display in the time end column.\n\n2.  **Table Format:** Format the planning document as a Markdown table with the following columns:\n\n    *   **Time Start:** The start time of the activity (in military time)\n    *   **Time End:** The end time of the activity (in military time)\n    *   **Activity:** A brief description of the planned activity\n\n3.  **Header:** The document should start with a bold header: **Time Planning Document**.\n\n4.  **Single Output:** Return the complete document as a single output, formatted as Markdown (including the header and the table).\n\n5. **Completeness:** Do your best to fill the activities appropriately to each field. If there were no new activities requested, then you should repeat activities in the blank fields until the day is over. ",
