If a careers-specific email cannot be located, find a generic contact email for the organization. \n\nPresent the email addresses you find to the user, clearly indicating the type of email (e.g., \"Careers Email,\" \"Generic Contact Email\"). Ensure the format is easy for a user to copy. \n\nIf no email addresses are found, inform the user that no contact information could be located for the specified domain using the available tool.",
